Pocket casts ( au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts)
Registering once:
- Playing a cached track:
-- onActiveSessionsChanged() is triggered when hitting play, but not when hitting pause
-- No re-registration at all:
    We get state 3 (playing) every second, and when clicking pause, we also get state 2, but on the
    next click on play, no callbacks are received anymore
-- Re-registration:
--- Only at onActiveSessionsChanged(): we get state 3 once, but it does not come every second, and
    we also don't get repeated (every 1 second) state 3, and state2 is also not triggered.
--- Only at handler end: we get regular callback calls when re-registering either after a CB finished, or
    whenever onActiveSessionsChanged().
- Playing new tracks that need to be loaded: the first few calls indicate states like 0 (None) and
    6, but then the CBs die and we don't get the CB with 3 once the track starts playing
    This can only be fixed by also re-registering callbacks at onActiveSessionsChanged(), in addition
    to also re-registering them at the end of a handler

Doggcatcher - com.snoggdoggler.android.applications.doggcatcher.v1_0:
- Starting playback triggers onActiveSessionsChanged(). Unfortunately we only receive events for
    when playback starts (3), but never when it stops, no matter how often and no matter when we
    re-register the media CBs

SessionToken stays stable
A single registration on a new onActiveSessionsChanged() change is sufficient - however, you have to
 discern the session token!
==============
Spotify - com.spotify.music
SessionToken not stable
Won't be called back when user pauses playback!
